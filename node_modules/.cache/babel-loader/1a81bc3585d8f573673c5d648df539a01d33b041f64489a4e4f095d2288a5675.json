The Colosseum, also called the Amphitheatrum Flavium, was opened by emperor Titus with games and festivities that lasted 100 days and cost the lives of 5,000 animals. Emperor Domitian, Titus' successor, later expanded the amphitheatre with an extra storey and a number of spaces underneath the Colosseum.

It was built to commemorate the city's reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake. It has six columns (some 11 m high) and is adorned with statues of various historical figures. Significant height from the arch crown to the cornice imparts an appearance of heaviness to the structure. The associated space is filled with the coat of arms of Portugal. The allegorical group at the top, made by French sculptor Célestin Anatole Calmels, represents Glory rewarding Valor and Genius.\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default info"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAMA,IAAI,GAAG,CACT;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,oKAAoK;EACzKC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,iLAAiL;EACtLC,WAAW,EAAE,kBAAkB;EAC/BC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,sGAAsG;EAC3GC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,mKAAmK;EACxKC,WAAW,EAAE,WAAW;EACxBC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,4HAA4H;EACjIC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,kKAAkK;EACvKC,WAAW,EAAE,UAAU;EACvBC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,oLAAoL;EACzLC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,qLAAqL;EAC1LC,WAAW,EAAE,8BAA8B;EAC3CC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,sLAAsL;EAC3LC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,gLAAgL;EACrLC,WAAW,EAAE,iBAAiB;EAC9BC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,qGAAqG;EAC1GC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,qKAAqK;EAC1KC,WAAW,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAClCC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,mLAAmL;EACxLC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,mMAAmM;EACxMC,WAAW,EAAE,oBAAoB;EACjCC,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC1CN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,wGAAwG;EAC7GC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,iKAAiK;EACtKC,WAAW,EAAE,gBAAgB;EAC7BC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG;EACPC,GAAG,EAAE,sJAAsJ;EAC3JC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,4KAA4K;EACjLC,WAAW,EAAE,+BAA+B;EAC5CC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,wMAAwM;EAC7MC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,8KAA8K;EACnLC,WAAW,EAAE,0BAA0B;EACvCC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,kHAAkH;EACvHC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,uKAAuK;EAC5KC,WAAW,EAAE,oCAAoC;EACjDC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,6HAA6H;EAClIC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,kLAAkL;EACvLC,WAAW,EAAE,4BAA4B;EACzCC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,gFAAgF;EACrFC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,4LAA4L;EACjMC,WAAW,EAAE,kBAAkB;EAC/BC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,iHAAiH;EACtHC,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;EAChBC,GAAG,EAAE,wKAAwK;EAC7KC,WAAW,EAAE,OAAO;EACpBC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,kJAAkJ;EACvJC,OAAO,EAAE,SAAS;EAClBC,GAAG,EAAE,0LAA0L;EAC/LC,WAAW,EAAE,YAAY;EACzBC,IAAI,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACxCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,+FAA+F;EACpGC,OAAO,EAAE,SAAS;EAClBC,GAAG,EAAE,uNAAuN;EAC5NC,WAAW,EAAE,iBAAiB;EAC9BC,IAAI,EAAE,mCAAmC;EACzCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,sEAAsE;EAC3EC,OAAO,EAAE,UAAU;EACnBC,GAAG,EAAE,kWAAkW;EACvWC,WAAW,EAAE,sBAAsB;EACnCC,IAAI,EAAE,gCAAgC;EACtCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACIC,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI;EACRC,GAAG,EAAE,qGAAqG;EAC1GC,OAAO,EAAE,UAAU;EACnBC,GAAG,EAAE,mLAAmL;EACxLC,WAAW,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAClCC,IAAI,EAAE,gCAAgC;EACtCN,IAAI,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,CACJ;AAED,eAAeA,IAAI"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
